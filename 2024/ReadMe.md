I've separated out the data folders and results into a separate (private) repository.

The source files expect to find two folders here:

	../AOCdata/<year>
		/Puzzle
		/Test

They should each contain the inputs for the days' puzzles, in the format:

	Day01.txt
	Day02.txt
	etc.

In the cases where there is more than one set of test data for the day (e.g. day 1) they are numbered:

	Day01-1.txt
	Day01-2.txt
